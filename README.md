# initial_pyplot_work
I was doing electrical device measurements that varied in a small number of ways and I wanted to write some code that plotted them all without any intervention from me.

The variables were things like:
Sweep direction (or both ways)
Current vs Time, or vs Voltage
Multiple sweeps with different gate voltages (or multiple voltage sweeps at one gate voltage)

...it turns out that I basically spent a lot of time re-writing a highly limited and worse version of pandas from the ground up.

It makes good coders cry.
